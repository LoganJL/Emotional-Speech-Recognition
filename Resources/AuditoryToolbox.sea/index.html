Thistoolbox will also be useful to speech and auditory engineers who want tosee how the human auditory system represents sounds.<P>This version of the toolbox fixes several bugs, especially in the Gammatoneand MFCC implementations, and adds several new functions. This report waspreviously published as Apple Computer Technical Report #45. We appreciatereceiving permission from Apple Computer to republish their code and toupdate this package.<P>There are many ways to describe and represent sounds. The figure belowshows one taxonomy based on signal dimensionality. A simple waveform isa one-dimensional representation of sound. The two-dimensional representationdescribes the acoustic signal as a time-frequency image. This is the typicalapproach for sound and speech analysis. This toolbox includes conventionaltools such as the short-time-Fourier-Transform (STFT or Spectrogram) andseveral cochlear models that estimate auditory nerve firing “probabilities”as a function of time. Finally, the next level of abstraction is to summarizethe periodicities of the cochlear output with the correlogram. The correlogramprovides a powerful representation that makes it easier to understand multiplesounds and to perform auditory scene analysis.<BR>&nbsp;<H2>What does the Auditory Toolbox contain?</H2>Six types of auditory time-frequency representations are implemented inthis toolbox:<OL><LI>&nbsp;Richard F. Lyon has described an auditory model based on a transmissionline model of the basilar membrane and followed by several stages of adaptation.This model can represent sound at either a fine time scale (probabilitiesof an auditory nerve firing) or at the longer time scales characteristicof the spectrogram or MFCC analysis. The <I>LyonPassiveEar</I> commandimplements this particular ear model.</LI><LI>&nbsp;Roy Patterson has proposed a model of psychoacoustic filtering basedon critical bands. This auditory front-end combines a Gammatone filterbank with a model of hair cell dynamics proposed by Ray Meddis. This auditorymodel is implemented using the <I>MakeERBFilters</I>, <I>ERBFilterBank</I>,and <I>MeddisHairCell</I> commands.</LI><LI>Stephanie Seneff has described a cochlear model that combines a criticalband filterbank with models of detection and automatic gain control. Thistoolbox implements stages I and II of her model.</LI><LI>Conventional FFT analysis is represented using the spectrogram. Both narrowband and wide band spectrograms are possible. See the spectrogram commandfor more information.</LI><LI>A common front-end for many speech recognition systems consists of Mel-frequencycepstral coefficients (MFCC). This technique combines an auditory filter-bankwith a cosine transform to give a rate representation roughly similar tothe auditory system. See the <I>mfcc</I> command for more information.In addition, a common technique known as <I>rasta</I> is included to filterthe coefficients, simulating the effects of masking and providing speechrecognition system a measure of environmental adaptation.</LI><LI>Conventional speech-recognition systems often use linear-predictive analysisto model a speech signal. The forward transform, <I>proclpc</I>, and itsinverse, <I>synlpc</I> are included.</LI></OL><H2>How do I get the Auditory Toolbox?</H2>The following files are available for downloading.<UL><LI><A HREF="AuditoryToolboxTechReport.pdf">Documentation (PDF, 1.1M)</A></LI><LI><A HREF="AuditoryToolbox.tar">Unix archive, includes documentation (TAR,1.5M)</A></LI><LI><A HREF="AuditoryToolbox.sea.hqx">Macintosh archive, includes documentation&nbsp;(self extracting Bin Hex, 0.9M)</A></LI><LI><A HREF="AuditoryToolbox.zip">Windows archive, includes documentation&nbsp;(WinZip, 0.9M)</A></LI></UL>I have put this collection of code together to support my own research.&nbsp;I&nbsp; hope by adding documentation and testing that other researcherswill also benefit from this work.<P>This archive contains ".m" files, M<FONT SIZE=-1>ATLAB</FONT> mex files,and the C sources&nbsp; needed to create the mex files.&nbsp; I have testedthis code on Macintosh, PC,&nbsp; SGI, and Sun computers running M<FONT SIZE=-1>ATLAB</FONT>5.2.&nbsp; The code is reasonably&nbsp; portable, so I don't expect anyproblems on any machine running M<FONT SIZE=-1>ATLAB</FONT>.<P>After installing this software on your machine, use the test_auditory&nbsp;script to run through the examples in the documentation.<BR>&nbsp;<H2>Is there support for the Auditory Toolbox?</H2>Needless to say, support is limited.&nbsp; I use this code, so I am interested&nbsp;in hearing bug reports.&nbsp; I'll fix them if I can reproduce them andI have&nbsp; the time.&nbsp; But no guarantees.&nbsp; Sending bug fixesis a good way to make sure&nbsp; I pay attention.<P>Please let me know if you have comments or questions.&nbsp; I can bereached&nbsp; at<ADDRESS>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malcolm Slaney</ADDRESS><ADDRESS>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interval Research Corporation</ADDRESS><ADDRESS>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1801 Page Mill Road, BuildingC</ADDRESS><ADDRESS>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Palo Alto, CA 94304</ADDRESS><ADDRESS></ADDRESS><ADDRESS>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A HREF="mailto:malcolm@interval.com">malcolm@interval.com</A></ADDRESS><BR>&nbsp;</BODY></HTML>
